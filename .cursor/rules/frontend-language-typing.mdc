TypeScript is mandatory. Strictly type all props, state, and functions.
Avoid any. Use specific types or unknown as a last resort.
Type Locations:
Global Types: src/types/
Navigation Types: src/navigation/navigation.types.ts

Component Props: Co-locate with the component or import clearly. Define component props using type or interface, e.g., type MyComponentProps = { ... };.

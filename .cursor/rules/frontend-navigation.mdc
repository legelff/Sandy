Library: Use @react-navigation/native-stack.
Setup: The main navigator is defined in src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx.

Type-Safe Routes: Use the types defined in src/navigation/navigation.types.ts for all navigation actions (useNavigation, route props). This ensures type safety for route names and parameters.

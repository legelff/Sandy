Local State: Use the useState hook for state local to a single component.
Global State: Use the designated library (e.g., Zustand) located in src/store/ for app-wide state (like user auth).
API Calls:
Abstract all API logic into functions within src/services/.
Components should not make direct API calls.
Async Operations:
Always implement and show loading states (e.g., spinners, skeletons).

Use try-catch blocks for all async operations and show user-friendly error messages.

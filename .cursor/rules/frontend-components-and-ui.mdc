Component Structure: Follow Atomic Design.
Atoms: Basic UI elements in src/components/common/.
Molecules/Organisms: Combine atoms/molecules into more complex, reusable components.
Single Responsibility: Components should do one thing well. Decompose complex components.
Reusability First: Before creating a new component, check if a reusable one can be made.

Documentation: Use JSDoc comments for all components and their props.
